/**
 * Paragon is going to be the new Incode Labs Semi-Artificial Intelligence for
 * determining security risks and detecting suspicious behaviour in products
 * like Huntington Post: Project Clandestine. It will utilize a series of
 * triggers (perceptrons) to tell it what is happening. Triggers will be able to
 * be set for different things, like if a user has read only one article but
 * is online every day. Or if a user re-reads articles a lot. Examples like
 * these are not bad things by themselves, but may be a clue to bad behaviour.
 * 
 * Users that display a possibility of, say, being a bot, or if an IP (not a
 * user) searches for all articles and nothing else, or only ever visits user
 * profiles, is considered suspicious behaviour. In fact, Paragon may create an
 * account for specific IP addresses, and if they do end up creating an account,
 * the IP account would jsut be overwritten.
 * 
 * I'm hoping that Paragon may also someday expand to other products to detect
 * suspicious behaviour.
 * 
 * This is just the tip of the iceberg in what it will be able to do, and may
 * someday get an upgrade into deep learning and dreaming, but not quite yet.
 * 
 * It's time to get building!
